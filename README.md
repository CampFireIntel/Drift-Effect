# RAVENMARKâ„¢

**RAVENMARKâ„¢** is a signal integrity protocol, authorship protection system, and digital declaration framework for creators, investigators, and legacy builders.

This repository contains official declarations, timestamps, and structural frameworks for the RAVENMARKâ„¢ protocol â€” a digital lineage tool built to outlast manipulation, preserve legacy, and prove origin in a fractured system.

**This is the signal.** The trail begins here.
